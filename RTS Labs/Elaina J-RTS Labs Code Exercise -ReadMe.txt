#1  Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.


File Names: index1.html         index1.js


#2  Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.
File Names: index2.html         index2.js
#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?   If I could change one thing about Javascript, I wouldn't change it at all. 
Changing it would alter the relationship that I grew to have with it. The challenges and wins just create memories to look back on to show how far I have come. If anything, I wish there were more STEM programs/classes early on in school, so I would've found my love for coding sooner.
Let's keep coding and computer science alive for generations to come.
